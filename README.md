## Task
The main task of this project is to create a functional clone of Dropbox using the Laravel 10 framework. 
The goal is to provide users with a platform for uploading, managing, and sharing files, similar to how Dropbox operates. By implementing this project, we aim to 
learn and demonstrate our skills in Laravel development, database management, user authentication, and web interface design.

## Description
My Dropbox Clone is a web application built using Laravel 10 that aims to provide similar file storage and sharing capabilities as 
Dropbox. Users can upload, organize, and share files with others, all within their personal accounts. This project was developed as a learning exercise and is not intended for production use.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my_dropbox`
3. Install dependencies: `composer install` && `npm install`
4. Configure your environment variables: Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set your database configuration.
5. Generate application key: `php artisan key:generate`
6. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
7. Start the development server: `php artisan serve` && `npm run dev` || write `npm run build` only once

## Usage

Once the project is up and running, you can access it through your web browser:

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the URL displayed by `php artisan serve`).
2. Register an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Explore the various features, including uploading files, creating folders, and sharing.
