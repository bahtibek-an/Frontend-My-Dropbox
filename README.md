# Welcome to My Dropbox
Welcome to my first Dropbox App.

##Link https://dropboxreactjsapp.netlify.app/

## Task
You will have to code some lambda + a frontend app.
ReactJS will be your techno!

User - authentification
Upload a file
Versioning
DNS/Routing

## Description
First, what is dropbox? :)
Amazon has a free tier. You should be able to host it for 0$. :)

Dropbox is a file hosting service operated by the American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software.

=> File synchronization, that sounds cool!

Secondly, what is serverless?
Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers.

=> We configure a backend at from a provider and it will handle the load/scaling for us.

Let's implement a file synchronization using Amplify & Lambda & S3

Example of architecture:

## Installation
1. npx create-react-app
2. npm i firebase uuid
3. npm i react-icons
4. npm i react-redux
5. npm i @reduxjs/toolkit
6. npm i @emotion/styled
7. npm i @emotion/react
8. npm i @mui/icons-material
9. npm i @material-ui/icons
10. npm i @material-ui/core
11. npm i react-dom

## Usage
A fully hosted version in the cloud. (at least until the correction happened)

The url of your project will be store inside the readme.

No more than 1 components per file.
Additionals components will be in src/components/

CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css.

Your Readme will have to describe the project.
Your .gitignore must remove node_modules/

On the css/colors/design, you can be creative.
