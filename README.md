# Description

What is dropbox could be a serverless app?
This is what it's all about!

First, what is dropbox? :)
Amazon has a free tier. You should be able to host it for 0$. :)

Dropbox is a file hosting service operated by the American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software.

=> File synchronization, that sounds cool!

# Task

A fully hosted version in the cloud. (at least until the correction happened)

The url of your project will be store inside the readme.

No more than 1 components per file. Additionals components will be in src/components/

CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css.

On the css/colors/design, you can be creative.
