# Description

Amazon has a free tier. You should be able to host it for 0$. :)

Dropbox is a file hosting service operated by the American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software.

=> File synchronization, that sounds cool!

Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers.

=> We configure a backend at from a provider and it will handle the load/scaling for us.

Let's implement a file synchronization using Amplify & Lambda & S3

# Task

A fully hosted version in the cloud. (at least until the correction happened)

The url of your project will be store inside the readme.

No more than 1 components per file. Additionals components will be in src/components/

CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css.

Your Readme will have to describe the project. Your .gitignore must remove node_modules/

On the css/colors/design, you can be creative.

You will have to code some lambda + a frontend app. ReactJS will be your techno!

# Installation

npm i or npm install 

# Usage

localhost:5173
