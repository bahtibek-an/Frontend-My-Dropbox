# Description

Dropbox founder Drew Houston conceived the Dropbox concept after repeatedly forgetting his USB flash drive while he was a student at MIT.[20]

Houston founded Evenflow, Inc. in May 2007[21] as the company behind Dropbox, and shortly thereafter secured seed funding from Y Combinator.[22] Dropbox was officially launched at 2008's TechCrunch Disrupt, an annual technology conference.[23] Owing to trademark disputes between Proxy, Inc. and Evenflow, Dropbox's official domain name was "getdropbox.com" until October 2009, when it acquired its current domain, "dropbox.com".[23] In October 2009, Evenflow, Inc. was renamed Dropbox, Inc.[24]

In an interview with TechCrunch's "Founder Stories" in October 2011, Houston explained that a demo video was released during Dropbox's early days, with one viewer being Arash Ferdowsi. Ferdowsi was "so impressed" that they formed a partnership. In regards to competition, Houston stated that "It is easy for me to explain the idea, it is actually really hard to do it."[25]
