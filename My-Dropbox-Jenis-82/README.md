## Task 

The primary task of this project is to create a cloud-hosted file-sharing platform with user authentication, file upload functionality, versioning support, and DNS/routing capabilities. The goal is to provide a secure and efficient solution for users to manage and share files. This Dropbox project offers a comprehensive cloud-based file-sharing platform with the following features: Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the file-sharing platform. Users can easily upload files to the platform, facilitating seamless collaboration and sharing. The project incorporates versioning support, allowing users to track and manage different versions of files. Efficient DNS/routing mechanisms are implemented to ensure smooth navigation and accessibility. The hosted version of the project can be accessed at [Project URL](https://your-project-url.com).
To get started with the project, follow these steps: The project follows a modular structure, with each component contained in its own file. Additional components are placed in the directory. CSS associated with each component is stored in separate files, following the convention of styling. Feel free to be creative with the design, colors, and CSS styles. The project encourages innovative approaches to enhance the user experience.
The project is fully hosted in the cloud, and the URL can be found at [Project URL](https://your-project-url.com). However, please note that the hosted version will be available until the necessary corrections are made.

## Description

What is dropbox could be a serverless app?
This is what it's all about!
First, what is dropbox? :)
Amazon has a free tier. You should be able to host it for 0$. :)
Dropbox is a file hosting service operated by the American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software.
=> File synchronization, that sounds cool!
Secondly, what is serverless?
Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers. => We configure a backend at from a provider and it will handle the load/scaling for us. Let's implement a file synchronization using Amplify & Lambda & S3
You will have to code some lambda + a frontend app. ReactJS will be your techno!
SPECIFICATIONS: User - authentification Upload a file Versioning DNS/Routing
REQUIREMENTS: A fully hosted version in the cloud. (at least until the correction happened)
The url of your project will be store inside the readme. No more than 1 components per file. Additionals components will be in src/components CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css. Your Readme will have to describe the project. Your .gitignore must remove node_modules/ On the css/colors/design, you can be creative.
