You will have to code some lambda + a frontend app.
ReactJS will be your techno!

## SPECIFICATIONS
User - authentification
Upload a file
Versioning
DNS/Routing

## REQUIREMENTS
A fully hosted version in the cloud. (at least until the correction happened)

The url of your project will be store inside the readme.

No more than 1 components per file.
Additionals components will be in `src/components/`

CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css.

Your Readme will have to describe the project.
Your .gitignore must remove node_modules/

On the css/colors/design, you can be creative.
